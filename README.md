## DayNotes
### Date-based note taking platform

DayNotes is a Front-End web development project that allows users to make date-based note documents using the Quill.js text editor alongside
a calendar that visualizes your created notes. When a user signs up, their notes are stored within a MongoDB database behind
their secure Auth0 user validation. Utilizing the power of Socket.io web sockets, DayNotes allows users to have 
instantaneously updating documents for real-time synchronization between your browser tabs.
